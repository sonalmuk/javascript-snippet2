Working with Arrays


Array is an object in Javascript and it comes with several useful methods that allow you to manipulate strings or data contained in any given array.
Let's take a look at the reverse() function today.

As the name suggests, the data in the array can be arranged in reverse order using the reverse function like so :

<code>
var arrayOfName=["tom", "peter","susan","zack"];
console.log(arrayOfName);    // outputs ["tom", "peter", "susan", "zack"]
reverseNames=arrayOfName.reverse()
console.log(reverseNames);   // outputs ["zack", "susan", "peter", "tom"]
</code>
One important thing to remember is that when you create an array using a reverse it does not cretae another copy of the array. In this example, the reverseNames array is a reference to the original array  or it just points to the original arrayOfName array.

Let's prove it.

Proof #1. Display the value of arrayOfNames in console after applying the reverse(). 
<code>
console.log(arrayOfNames) // outputs ["zack", "susan", "peter", "tom"]
</code>

Proof#2. Add another name to arrayOfNames and reverseNames array each. The names "amy" and "bob" will be added to both the original and the reversed array like below

<code>
arrayOfName.push("amy");
reverseNames.push("bob");
console.log(arrayOfName);  //outputs    ["zack", "susan", "peter", "tom", "amy", "bob"]
console.log(reverseNames); //outputs    ["zack", "susan", "peter", "tom", "amy", "bob"]
</code>

Proof #3. Finally, deleteing elements from either of the arrays , deletes it from the other array too.

<code>
reverseNames.pop();
console.log(arrayOfName);  //outputs    "zack", "susan", "peter", "tom", "amy"]
console.log(reverseNames); //outputs    "zack", "susan", "peter", "tom", "amy"]
</code>
